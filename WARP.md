# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TakePack is a courier application currently in early development stage. The repository contains only a basic README.md file and is at the initial commit stage.

## Repository Status

This is a new/empty repository that has been initialized but does not yet contain:
- Source code files
- Build configuration
- Package management files
- Test files
- Development tooling

## Development Environment

Since the project is in its initial state, future development setup will likely require:
- Determining the technology stack (web, mobile, desktop application)
- Setting up appropriate build tools and package managers
- Establishing project structure and architecture
- Adding development dependencies and scripts

## Notes for Future Development

When code is added to this repository, this WARP.md file should be updated to include:
- Build and development commands
- Project architecture overview
- Testing procedures
- Deployment instructions
- Technology-specific guidance

The courier application domain suggests this will likely involve:
- Location/GPS functionality
- User management (couriers, customers)
- Order/package tracking
- Mobile-first development approach
